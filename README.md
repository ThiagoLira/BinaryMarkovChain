# BinaryMarkovChain
One script will generate a binary sequence according  to some probabilistic rule. The other will create statistics and try to guess those rules. 


Run `python3 genseq.py` to generate a new file called sample2.txt.

Then run `python3 seqlib.py` to print statistics about this file.
